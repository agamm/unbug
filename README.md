## Unbug

Got a code base? Want an automatic bug detector that runs during your CI stage on GitHub?
For free? Just follow the installation step below.

I'm the creator of [Unzip.dev](https://unzip.dev) a developer trends newsletter. A few months ago I thought about
jumping the LMM hypetrain and create some DevTool in the space. At the time there wasn't a single GitHub marketplace app
that tackled bug detection (at least not using LLMs). So I decided to build it.

As time passed I started seeing Co-Pilot suggesting they would also get into the CI space and then saw others joining the marketplace. So I decided to give me code for free.

_May the force be with you, and find all your pesky bugs :pray:_
